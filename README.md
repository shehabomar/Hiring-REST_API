Install project dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:4000`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Pagination and Filtering**: Add options for pagination and advanced filtering for large datasets.
- **Improved Security**: Implement rate-limiting, input sanitization, and CSRF protection.
- **Notification System**: Notify candidates of application status updates via email or SMS.
